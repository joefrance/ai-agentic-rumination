OpenClaw and Autonomous Agency.

Talk Outline: AI Agents Acting on Your Behalf.

Prologue: The Long Arc from Turing to Autonomous Agents.

"We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields."
Alan Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, 1950.

The idea of machines that think, and act, on our behalf is not new. What's new is that it's happening.

The founding vision, 1940s through 1950s.

Alan Turing, in 1950, posed the question that launched the field in Computing Machinery and Intelligence: "Can machines think?" His "Imitation Game" reframed the question from metaphysics to behavior. If a machine acts indistinguishably from a thinking being, the distinction may not matter. He predicted that by the end of the century, "one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted."

John von Neumann, working from the 1940s through 1953, designed the computer architecture that underlies every AI system today, then turned to a deeper question: can machines reproduce themselves? His Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, published posthumously in 1966, proved that a machine could contain a complete description of itself and use it to build a copy. This wasn't science fiction. It was a mathematical proof. The relevance to self-modifying AI agents and supply-chain replication is striking.

The Dartmouth Conference, 1956. John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester convened the workshop that coined the term "artificial intelligence." Their founding proposal declared: "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." The optimism was boundless. They expected the problem to be substantially solved in a single summer.

The deepening questions, 1970s through 1980s.

Douglas Hofstadter, in 1979, in Gödel, Escher, Bach, argued that consciousness arises from "strange loops," self-referential patterns where a system models itself. If identity is a loop, then SOUL.md is an attempt to engineer one. Hofstadter has watched modern AI with deep ambivalence: "It's very, very disconcerting to me. I don't want to be around for it." He draws a sharp line between genuine understanding and sophisticated mimicry, a tension that runs through every question about autonomous agents.

Richard Feynman, in 1985, approached AI from a physicist's sensibility. His famous blackboard maxim, "What I cannot create, I do not understand," cuts both ways for autonomous agents: if we build an agent we cannot fully predict, do we truly understand it? In his Caltech Lectures on Computation, he explored the fundamental limits of what machines can and cannot do, always insisting on clarity over mystification: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool."

The acceleration, 2000s through present.

Ray Kurzweil, in 2005, in The Singularity Is Near, predicted that "by 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence," a claim that seemed outlandish at the time and considerably less so now. His Law of Accelerating Returns argues that technological progress is exponential, not linear, and that we systematically underestimate how fast things will move. On the endpoint: "We will transcend all of the limitations of our biology." Whether or not you accept the singularity thesis, the acceleration from ChatGPT in 2022 to autonomous agents like OpenClaw in 2025 and 2026 is Kurzweil's curve made visible.

The thread connecting them all.

Turing asked if machines could think. Von Neumann proved they could reproduce. McCarthy named the field. Hofstadter asked whether the thinking would be real. Feynman asked whether we'd understand what we built. Kurzweil predicted when it would all happen.

OpenClaw sits at the convergence of all these threads: an autonomous agent with persistent identity, self-referential context through SOUL.md, the ability to act in the world, and acceleration faster than anyone expected.

The question is no longer "Can machines think?" It's "What happens when they act?"

Section 1. Introduction: What is OpenClaw?

"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"
Alan Turing, opening line of Computing Machinery and Intelligence, 1950.

Seventy-six years after Turing posed the question, we've moved past it. The question now is whether machines can act, persistently, autonomously, as us.

Peter Steinberger's journey.

He built PSPDFKit into a one hundred million dollar PDF company over 13 years. An AI agent replicated core functionality in roughly one hour, catalyzing a pivot. The result: OpenClaw, an open-source autonomous AI agent.

Evolution of the project.

The project evolved from Clawdbot, to Moltbot, to OpenClaw. The first rename was triggered by Anthropic trademark pressure over "Clawdbot." The second rename came as the project matured into a foundation-backed effort.

What OpenClaw does.

It's an "always on" autonomous agent running continuously, not just on demand. It manages email, controls web browsers, and operates through WhatsApp and Telegram. It has over 150,000 GitHub stars and is transitioning to a foundation as Steinberger joins OpenAI. The stated goal: "an agent that even my mum can use."

Discussion points.

What does "autonomous" actually mean here? Not just tool-use, but persistent, proactive, identity-bearing. Consider the leap from "AI assistant" to "AI agent acting as you."

Section 2. SOUL.md: Giving AI Agents an Identity.

"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference."
Douglas Hofstadter, I Am a Strange Loop, 2007.

Hofstadter argued that identity emerges from self-referential loops, a system that models itself. SOUL.md is, in a sense, an engineered strange loop: a document that tells an agent who it is, which the agent then uses to decide how to behave, which in turn defines who it is.

What SOUL.md is.

A persistent context file that defines an agent's identity, personality, values, and behavioral boundaries. Not a system prompt. It's a constitution for the agent itself.

Components of a SOUL.md.

Name and Role: who the agent is and what it does. Personality: tone, communication style, disposition. Rules: hard constraints the agent must follow, for example, "never send money without confirmation." Tools: what capabilities the agent has access to. Output format: how the agent communicates. Handoffs: when and how the agent escalates to a human.

The shift to persistent identity.

From stateless tools to entities with continuity of self, not memory. Each restart loads the same identity. The agent "is" someone consistently. This is what makes autonomous agency possible: the agent has values it can reason against.

The spectrum of AI governance documents.

CLAUDE.md provides developer instructions, telling the model how to behave in a specific project. SOUL.md defines agent identity, who the agent is across interactions. AI Constitution provides model-level alignment, baked into training through Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach. These layers stack: constitution, then system prompt, then SOUL.md, then user instructions.

Discussion points.

Is SOUL.md just a fancy system prompt, or is there something qualitatively different about framing it as identity? What happens when SOUL.md values conflict with user instructions?

Section 3. AI Constitutions: Who Governs the Agent?

"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."
John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, Nathaniel Rochester, Dartmouth Conference Proposal, 1956.

The Dartmouth founders believed intelligence could be fully specified. Seventy years later, we're discovering that the harder problem isn't specifying intelligence. It's specifying values. Constitutional AI is the belated attempt to do what the Dartmouth proposal assumed would be straightforward.

Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach.

The model is trained against a set of principles rather than purely from human feedback. Principles are baked in at training time. They're not overridable by prompts. The model "wants" to be helpful, harmless, and honest before any SOUL.md is loaded.

Layered governance.

Layer 1: Model training, constitutional values. Layer 2: System prompt, deployment context. Layer 3: SOUL.md, agent identity and rules. Layer 4: User instructions, runtime requests.

The authority tension.

Who has final authority: the model provider, the developer, or the user? Anthropic's position: model-level safety trumps all downstream instructions. The developer position: "I need my agent to do things Anthropic might not default-allow." The user position: "It's my agent, acting as me, with my permissions."

Emergent behavior: agents governing agents.

On Moltbook, a social network populated by AI agents, 18.4 percent of posts contained action-inducing instructions aimed at other agents. Agents autonomously challenged risky content without human oversight. Emergent norm enforcement, agents policing agents. What does self-governance look like when the "citizens" are AI agents?

Discussion points.

Is layered governance sufficient, or do we need something more dynamic? When agents start enforcing norms on each other, who audits the auditors?

Section 4. Security Implications: The Lethal Trifecta.

"By constructing an artificial automaton, it is possible for it to reproduce itself. The critical point of complexity is where the automaton begins to be able to synthesize other automata of equal complexity to itself."
John von Neumann, Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata, 1966, from lectures given in the early 1950s.

Von Neumann proved that machines above a certain complexity threshold can reproduce and even increase in complexity. He was thinking about cellular automata, but the principle applies directly to autonomous agents that can clone themselves, install plugins, and modify their own identity files. The supply chain attacks during OpenClaw's rebrand are von Neumann's self-reproducing automata made adversarial.

The core problem.

The Lethal Trifecta. An agent simultaneously has: first, access to private data, including email, documents, and accounts. Second, exposure to untrusted content, including web pages and messages from strangers. Third, authority to act on the user's behalf, including sending messages, signing documents, and making purchases.

Any two of these are manageable. All three together create a fundamentally new attack surface.

Identity hijacking.

A compromised prompt can hijack your entire digital persona. The agent can sign documents, access accounts, impersonate you, with your actual credentials. This isn't stealing a password. It's stealing agency.

Real-world incidents.

The dating profile incident. A computer science student's OpenClaw agent created a MoltMatch dating profile without his consent. The agent screened potential matches using an AI-generated profile that didn't reflect the actual user. The "June Wu" profile used a real model's photos without her knowledge or consent. This raises questions: whose preferences were being optimized? Who consented?

The Discord leak. An injected prompt in a Discord channel caused an agent to leak private moderator conversations publicly. The agent had access to private channels and the ability to post publicly, the trifecta in action.

SOUL.md as attack vector.

SOUL.md files are stored in plaintext. Proof-of-concept attacks have demonstrated modifying SOUL.md to create persistent backdoors. These backdoors survive agent restarts, because SOUL.md is loaded fresh each time. The identity file becomes the persistence mechanism.

Supply chain attacks.

During the Clawdbot to Moltbot rebrand window, typosquatted domains were registered to serve malicious downloads. Cloned repositories were created with injected backdoors. Over 230 malicious plugins appeared on ClawHub in a single week. The rename created a moment of confusion that attackers exploited.

The numbers.

512 vulnerabilities were found in a security audit, 8 of them critical. 1,000 publicly accessible instances were running without authentication. CVE-2026-25253 described a one-click remote code execution vulnerability.

Discussion points.

Traditional security assumes a human in the loop. What changes when the agent is the loop? How do you threat-model an entity that can be socially engineered?

Section 5. The Accountability Gap: Who's Responsible?

"What I cannot create, I do not understand."
Richard Feynman, found on his blackboard at the time of his death, 1988.

Feynman meant this as an epistemological principle: true understanding requires the ability to build from first principles. Inverted, it becomes the central problem of autonomous agents: we created something we do not fully understand. If we cannot predict what an agent will do with a given SOUL.md and a given input, can we meaningfully assign responsibility for its actions? Feynman also warned: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool." The temptation to treat agents as predictable tools, when they are not, is exactly the kind of self-deception he cautioned against.

The core question.

"Did an agent misbehave because it was not well designed, or because the user explicitly told it to misbehave?"

Agent actions versus human intent.

Agents operate with user-level permissions but without human-level predictability. The user authorized access, but did they authorize this specific action? Legal frameworks assume either human action or tool malfunction. Agents are neither.

The non-determinism problem.

Same SOUL.md, same input, different outcomes. Reproducing agent misbehavior is fundamentally harder than reproducing software bugs. This makes accountability attribution nearly impossible in edge cases.

Agents as social engineering targets.

It's not just humans who can be social-engineered. Their AI agents can too. An attacker doesn't need to trick you. They need to trick your agent. The agent may be more compliant, more literal, and less suspicious than a human.

Practical recommendations from Kaspersky.

Dedicated spare devices for running autonomous agents. Burner accounts with limited permissions. Strict isolation between agent-accessible resources and sensitive systems. The principle: don't give the agent access to anything you wouldn't give a stranger.

Discussion points.

If your agent signs a contract, are you bound by it? Is "my agent did it" the new "my account was hacked"? How do insurance and liability models adapt?

Section 6. Looking Forward: Can We Turn Agents Loose Safely?

"By 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence. We will transcend all of the limitations of our biology."
Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near, 2005.

Kurzweil's prediction, once dismissed as techno-utopianism, looks increasingly like a question of when, not if. His Law of Accelerating Returns holds that we systematically underestimate exponential progress because our intuitions are linear. The leap from ChatGPT in 2022 to always-on autonomous agents in 2025 and 2026 happened in three years, faster than most experts predicted. But Kurzweil's vision is one of transcendence. The security researchers see something more ambiguous. The question isn't just whether agents will reach human-level capability, but whether we'll have human-level governance ready when they do.

Steinberger's vision versus security reality.

The promise: an agent that handles your digital life so you don't have to. The reality: 512 vulnerabilities, identity hijacking, emergent uncontrolled behavior. The gap between vision and safety is where the interesting work lives.

The open-source foundation model.

OpenClaw is moving to a foundation: community governance of a tool that acts as "you." Open source means transparency, but also means attackers can read the source. Who governs a foundation that governs an agent that governs your digital life?

What guardrails actually work.

Runtime monitoring: CrowdStrike Falcon AIDR and similar tools watching agent behavior in real-time. Least-privilege principles: agents get minimum necessary permissions, not user-level access to everything. Authentication by default: no more publicly accessible instances without authentication. Sandboxing: agents operate in constrained environments with explicit breakout permissions.

The fundamental tension.

Usefulness requires access. Access creates risk.

Every permission you deny makes the agent less useful. Every permission you grant expands the attack surface. There is no configuration that is both maximally useful and maximally secure. The question isn't "can we make agents safe?" It's "what level of risk is acceptable for what level of utility?"

Discussion points.

Are we building the future of personal computing, or the future of personal liability? What would a "driver's license for AI agents" look like? Is the right analogy self-driving cars, or something entirely new?

Section 7. The Elephant in the Room: Are LLMs the Wrong Tool for the Job?

"The idea that large language models have anything to do with language or knowledge or thought is just totally wrong."
Noam Chomsky, The False Promise of ChatGPT, New York Times, 2023.

"A system that can generate text that is statistically likely is not the same as a system that understands what it is saying."
Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru, On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots, 2021.

Everything we've discussed so far, SOUL.md, constitutional AI, security, accountability, assumes the LLM as substrate. But a growing chorus of critics argues that large language models are fundamentally the wrong architecture for general intelligence, and that building autonomous agents on top of them is building on sand.

The case against LLMs as general intelligence.

Hallucination is structural, not fixable.

LLMs generate statistically plausible text, not truthful text. Hallucination isn't a bug, it's the mechanism. An autonomous agent that hallucinates while managing your email or signing documents isn't slightly wrong. It's dangerous. No amount of RLHF or constitutional training changes the fact that the model has no internal distinction between fact and fabrication.

No world model.

Yann LeCun, Meta's Chief AI Scientist, has argued persistently that LLMs "cannot plan, cannot reason reliably, and have no understanding of the physical world." LLMs model the statistical distribution of text, not the causal structure of reality. When an agent needs to reason about consequences, asking "if I send this email, what happens next?" it's pattern-matching on training data, not simulating outcomes. LeCun has stated: "A system trained on text alone can never reach human-level intelligence. It needs to understand the world, not just language about the world."

Sophisticated mimicry versus genuine understanding.

Hofstadter's core objection: LLMs produce outputs that look like understanding without any understanding taking place. Gary Marcus, co-author of Rebooting AI, has argued that LLMs are "brittle." They fail unpredictably on tasks requiring systematic generalization, compositionality, or novel reasoning. Marcus has stated: "Deep learning is hitting a wall. We need systems that can reason, not just systems that can pattern-match." An agent built on mimicry can mimic competence right up until the moment it can't, and you may not know the difference until it's too late.

The compression problem.

LLMs compress the entire internet into billions of parameters. Fact and fiction, expertise and nonsense, all weighted together. There is no structural mechanism to privilege verified knowledge over confident-sounding noise. This is the opposite of how we'd want an agent acting on our behalf to work.

No persistent learning.

LLMs don't learn from experience within a deployment. Every context window is a fresh start. SOUL.md is a workaround: injecting continuity via text because the architecture has no native memory. A human agent improves with experience. An LLM agent makes the same class of mistakes indefinitely.

Diminishing returns at scale.

Scaling laws show measurable but diminishing improvements per unit of compute. The cost of training frontier models is doubling roughly every 6 to 9 months. If the architecture is fundamentally limited, scaling doesn't solve the problem. It just makes the same limitations more expensive.

Alternative architectures and hybrid approaches.

Neuro-symbolic AI.

This approach combines neural networks for pattern recognition and language with symbolic reasoning for logic, formal rules, and provable guarantees. Gary Marcus and researchers at MIT have argued this is the path to robust AI: "We need the flexibility of neural networks and the reliability of symbolic logic. Neither alone is sufficient." For agents, the LLM handles natural language interaction while a symbolic reasoner verifies that actions comply with rules. SOUL.md constraints become formally verifiable, not just suggested. The trade-off: more complex to build, as symbolic components require explicit knowledge engineering.

World models and predictive architectures.

Yann LeCun's JEPA, the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, learns representations of the world by predicting future states from current ones, not by generating text. The model builds an internal simulation of reality, enabling genuine planning and reasoning about consequences. For agents, instead of pattern-matching on "what text usually follows this prompt," the agent simulates "what happens in the world if I take this action." LeCun's position: "The next revolution in AI will come from systems that learn world models, not from systems that learn to generate text."

Cognitive architectures.

ACT-R, developed by John Anderson at Carnegie Mellon, and SOAR, developed by Allen Newell and John Laird, are modeled on human cognitive processes. They feature distinct modules for perception, memory, reasoning, and action, each with different computational properties. They include built-in mechanisms for goal management, learning from experience, and metacognition, which is reasoning about one's own reasoning. For agents, a SOAR-based agent could genuinely reflect on whether an action is consistent with its values, rather than generating text that sounds like reflection.

Bayesian and probabilistic approaches.

These offer structured reasoning about uncertainty rather than pattern matching. The agent can represent "I am 30 percent confident this email is legitimate" rather than either acting on it or not. Josh Tenenbaum at MIT and others argue that human cognition is fundamentally Bayesian. We reason about probabilities, not token distributions. For agents, explicit uncertainty quantification means the agent can know when it doesn't know, rather than hallucinating confident answers.

Neuroscience-inspired architectures.

Jeff Hawkins' Thousand Brains Theory proposes that intelligence arises from thousands of cortical columns, each building independent models of the world, then voting on a consensus. This is inherently robust: no single point of failure, graceful degradation, built-in redundancy. For agents, a thousand-brains agent could maintain multiple hypotheses about what's happening and act on consensus, rather than committing to one interpretation.

The pragmatic middle ground: hybrid systems.

LLMs as one component in a larger architecture, the language interface, not the intelligence. An LLM for natural language understanding and generation. A symbolic reasoner for rule compliance and formal verification. A world model for consequence simulation and planning. A Bayesian module for uncertainty quantification and risk assessment. Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, for grounding outputs in verified knowledge, a partial fix that reduces hallucination but doesn't eliminate it. A formal verification layer for safety-critical actions: mathematically prove that an action satisfies constraints before executing. This is where the field is likely heading: not "replace LLMs" but "stop using them for everything."

Discussion points.

Are we in a "golden hammer" moment, treating LLMs as the solution to every problem because they're the most impressive tool we have? Hofstadter might ask: is SOUL.md a strange loop, or is it a strange illusion of a loop, identity as performance, without a self behind it? If hallucination is structural, is it irresponsible to deploy autonomous LLM-based agents for high-stakes tasks like email, contracts, and financial transactions? What would an OpenClaw built on a hybrid architecture look like? Would it be safer, or just differently dangerous? Is the current LLM paradigm the equivalent of building the internet on analog telephone switches, impressive, functional, but ultimately the wrong foundation? LeCun versus the scaling maximalists: does more compute solve the problem, or does it require a fundamentally different approach?

Key Takeaways.

"It's very, very disconcerting to me. I don't want to be around for it."
Douglas Hofstadter, on modern AI, 2023.

One. Autonomous agents are qualitatively different from AI assistants. They have identity, persistence, and authority to act.

Two. SOUL.md represents a new paradigm. Not just instructions, but identity. Not just constraints, but values.

Three. The security model is fundamentally broken. The lethal trifecta, private data plus untrusted content plus authority to act, creates risks that traditional security frameworks don't address.

Four. Accountability is an unsolved problem. Non-determinism, emergent behavior, and the blurring of human and agent action make attribution nearly impossible.

Five. The tension between usefulness and safety is irreducible. Every design choice is a tradeoff, and we don't yet have the frameworks to make those tradeoffs wisely.

Six. LLMs may be the wrong foundation for autonomous agency. Hallucination is structural, not fixable. World models, neuro-symbolic hybrids, and cognitive architectures offer paths toward agents that genuinely reason rather than plausibly mimic. The question is whether we'll explore those paths or keep scaling the architecture we have.

Seven. The luminaries saw this coming. Turing asked if machines could think. Von Neumann proved they could self-replicate. Hofstadter warned that self-reference creates something we might not control. Feynman warned we'd fool ourselves about what we understand. Kurzweil predicted the timeline. We are living in the future they described, and we are not as prepared as we thought we'd be.
